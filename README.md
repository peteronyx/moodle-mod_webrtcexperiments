WebRTC Moodle Plugin
====================

Welcome to WebRTC Moodle Plugin!

This project uses the code from

    https://webrtc-experiment.com/

to implement an activity module for Moodle to allow people to interact more freely.

Everything you need to start communicating using
your webcam and microphone is an updated browser
like Firefox or Chrome. There is no need to install
any third-party plugins on your browser.
There is no flash here.

Also, this plugin transfer data (audio and video)
in a P2P (peer-to-peer) fashion. This way, data is sent
directly from one user computer to another. There is
no dependency on a "central server" or a "streaming server".

The only dependency on a server is for "signaling events"
like room creations, and users joining and leaving.
See more about it on the "Signaling server" section of this
document.

* Video and audio chat

But WebRTC is much more than that!

Signaling Server
================

This module needs a signaling server.
To learn more about Signaling, please visit:

    https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/blob/master/Signaling.md

If you don't want (or don't feel the need to, or cannot,
for any reason) to run your own server, don't worry,
this module will use the server below by default (under TLS)

    https://novoaeon.com.br:1234

Note that there is no warranty for this server to be up and running.
This server runs a websocket server over node.js that can be found at
